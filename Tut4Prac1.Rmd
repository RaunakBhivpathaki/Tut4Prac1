```{r global, include=FALSE}
knitr:: opts_chunk$set(fig.align = 'center')
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Learning to reference figures {#figures}

```{r FigRef, fig.cap="This is random noise."}
x = seq(1:100)
y = rnorm(100)
dat = data.frame(x, y)
ggplot(dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
geom_line()
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:FigRef), we plot x versus y as line plot.


# Learning to reference tables {#tables}

```{r TabRef}
knitr::kable( head(dat, n=5), caption = "This is the first 5 rows.")
```

In Table \@ref(tab:TabRef), we show the first 5 rows of the data.

# Conclusion
 In Section \@ref(figures), we learn to reference figures and in section \@ref(tables). we learn to reference tables

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
